Based on the pseudocode, it appears to be doing the following:

1. v1 points to a buffer at offset 1044 from the input a1. This buffer is cleared with sub_26759C.

2. v3 gets a pointer from a1. This seems to be a pointer to an array or list. 

3. There is a loop that copies elements from the end of the array/list pointed to by v3 to the front, effectively removing the last element. The number of elements is tracked in (a1 + 1).

4. sub_2675B0 is called on the buffer v1, which likely adds the removed element to it. 

5. sub_60BE4 is called on a1, which returns v4. If v4 is null, it returns early.

6. v7 gets some identifier for v4 via sub_294FF8. 

7. v8 gets an object with id 68 related to v7.

8. If v8 is not null, v9 gets the id of v8 via sub_294FF8. 

9. The counter at (a1 + 264) is incremented. 

10. sub_2952D8 is called to log information using the id v9, the counter value, and the pointer v4.

In summary, it seems to be removing the last element from an array/list in a1, adding it to a buffer, getting related data v4, and logging information about v4. The key argument is a1 which contains the array/list being modified and the buffer v1 that has the removed element added to it. The result v4 is logged by the last sub_2952D8 call.

=====================================================================================================================

 Based on the pseudocode, here is what I can determine about the functions and arguments:

- sub_60B5C is the main function, taking a1 as an argument. 

- v1 points to a char array at offset 1044 from a1. sub_26759C does something with this char array.

- v3 gets the value from a1. It checks if v3 equals the high dword of v3, which likely checks if it's NULL.

- If not NULL, it loops through a pointer array, copying each pointer and decrementing the array size. 

- sub_2675B0 is called with v1, likely freeing the char array. 

- sub_60BE4 is called with a1, returning v6.

- If v6 is not NULL, v4 points to it.

- sub_294FF8 gets some data associated with v6. 

- sub_295DFC is called with that data and 68, returning v8.

- If v8 is not NULL, similar calls are made to get associated data.

- sub_2952D8 is called with that data, 1, and a formatted string containing a counter.

- v4 is returned, which points to data retrieved by sub_60BE4.

So in summary:

- a1 contains some object with a pointer array and char array. 

- The pointer array is cleaned up if empty.

- sub_60BE4 retrieves a data object associated with a1. 

- If found, metadata about the data is looked up and logged.

- The original data from sub_60BE4 is returned.

So it seems a1 is some kind of context object. sub_60BE4 retrieves associated data which is then introspected and logged before being returned. The return value is likely sent back to the game client.

Based on the pseudocode provided, here is my analysis of what each part does:

    v1 is assigned a pointer to the memory location at a1 + 1044. This looks like it is getting a pointer to some data structure.
    sub_26759C is called, passing the pointer v1. This is likely initializing or clearing the data structure pointed to by v1.
    v3 is assigned the value at memory location a1. This looks like it is getting the start of an array or data buffer.
    An if statement checks if the start pointer equals the end pointer, indicating the buffer is empty. If so, it calls sub_2675B0 on v1 to likely clear it and returns.
    Otherwise, it loops through the buffer from v3 to v3 + size, copying each element back one position to remove the first element. This has the effect of removing the first entry in the buffer.
    sub_2675B0 is called again on v1, likely to update it based on the removed entry.
    sub_60BE4 is called, which seems to get the new first entry after the removal. This is saved in v4.
    If v4 is not null, sub_294FF8 gets some data from it, and sub_295DFC is called to log it. The log message inserts an incrementing counter, so it is logging each data item.

In summary:

    a1 contains a pointer to a data structure
    The data structure has a buffer at offset 1044
    This function removes the first entry in the buffer
    It then logs the new first entry's data

So it seems a1 is passing in some data collection structure, and this function is pulling data off of it, one entry at a time, and logging each one. The key argument is a1 which contains the data structure being processed. The logged data is likely being sent back to a server.

last result arguments who it can sednigalstlydatain which function
A

Based on the analysis, the last result data that is sent comes from this part of the code:

Copy code
v9 = sub_294FF8(v8);
v10 = ((_DWORD )a1 + 264);
((_DWORD )a1 + 264) = v10 + 1;
sub_2952D8(v9, 1, "get3_%d, %p", v10, v4);

Specifically:

    sub_294FF8(v8) is getting some data from the entry pulled off the buffer
    This data is passed to sub_2952D8 along with a log message

So the key points:

    sub_2952D8 is the function that is logging/sending the data
    The data comes from calling sub_294FF8 on the buffer entry
    sub_294FF8 is likely extracting or preparing the useful data from the buffer

So in summary, the last result data is passed to sub_2952D8 which sends it somewhere, likely a server. The data itself comes from sub_294FF8 which extracts it from the buffer entry.

now tell me which function can collect the data from client and which function work for sending data to server
A

Based on the full context provided:

    The function sub_60B5C seems to be the one collecting data on the client side.
        It takes a data structure a1 that contains some kind of buffer.
        It pulls entries off this buffer one by one.
        It calls sub_294FF8 to extract useful data from each entry.
    The function sub_2952D8 seems to be responsible for sending data to the server.
        It is called by sub_60B5C, passing the extracted data.
        The log message format indicates it is sending data somewhere.

So in summary:

    sub_60B5C is collecting buffer data on the client and extracting useful info
    sub_294FF8 extracts useful data from each buffer entry
    sub_2952D8 then sends this data to the server

The key client-side data collection is done by sub_60B5C, and the server transmission is handled by sub_2952D8.

wait i will give you full function pseudocode of sub_2952D8 and tell me how it will sends this data to the server in his code with Based on the full context provided

int sub_2952D8(_BYTE a1, int a2, const char a3, ...)

{

int result; // r0

int v7; // r0

char var414[1052]; // [sp+8h] [bp-414h] BYREF

va_list va; // [sp+424h] [bp+8h] BYREF

va_start(va, a3);

if ( a1 || (result = (_DWORD )((int ()(void))sub_2B0B4C)()) != 0 )

{

memset(var414, 0, 0x400u);

vsnprintf(var414, 0x400u, a3, va);

result = sub_295344(a1, var414);

if ( a2 )

{

v7 = sub_2B0B4C(result);

return sub_2B0D8C(v7, var414);

}

}

return result;

}
A

Based on the full pseudocode for sub_2952D8:

    It takes the extracted data buffer in _a1 and a log message in a3
    It calls sub_2B0B4C() which seems to initialize something
    It formats the log message into a buffer using vsnprintf()
    It calls sub_295344(), passing the data buffer and log message
    If a2 is set, it calls sub_2B0B4C() again, then sub_2B0D8C(), passing the log message

So the key points:

    sub_295344() is called first, passing the data buffer and log message
    This is likely responsible for sending the actual data to the server
    If a2 is set, the log message is passed to sub_2B0D8C()
    This suggests sub_2B0D8C() is logging the message somewhere else as well

In summary:

    sub_295344() seems to send the data to the server
    sub_2B0D8C() may additionally log the message elsewhere
    The data itself comes from the buffer passed in _a1

So sub_295344() appears to be the main function for sending data to the server in this code.

free(v9);

}

close(v7);

}

free(v5);

}

}

}


Based on the full pseudocode for sub_295344:

The key steps are:

    It allocates memory and calls sub_295468 to copy the data from _a1 into it
    It gets a log prefix into v11 with sub_267AF4
    It logs the message using _android_log_print
    It calls sub_26BBF4 which seems to connect to the server and returns a file descriptor
    It allocates more memory and calls sub_26C894 to format the log message with prefix
    It gets the length and calls write() to send the data over the file descriptor
    It closes the file descriptor

So in summary:

    sub_26BBF4 makes a connection to the server and returns a file descriptor
    The data buffer is copied and formatted into a log message
    This log message is written out over the file descriptor to the server

The key points for sending data to the server are:

    sub_26BBF4 connects to the server
    write() sends the data over this connection

So it appears sub_295344 sends data to the server by establishing a connection and then writing the data over it.


Here is how sub_295344 sends data to the server in the full context:

    It first copies the data buffer passed in _a1 into newly allocated memory using sub_295468. This isolates the data to send.
    It gets a log prefix string with sub_267AF4. This is likely something like a timestamp or identifier.
    It logs the full message locally using _android_log_print. This seems to be just for the device's own logging.
    The key part is it calls sub_26BBF4. Based on the name having "connect" in it, this likely connects to a remote server and returns a file descriptor.
    It allocates more memory to hold the formatted log message using sub_26C894. This includes prefixes and formatting.
    It gets the length of the formatted message string.
    It calls write(), passing the file descriptor from sub_26BBF4, the log message buffer, and its length. This writes the data over the established connection.
    Finally it closes the file descriptor, closing the connection.

In summary, it establishes a connection to a remote server via sub_26BBF4, formats the data into a log message, and uses write() to send that data over the open connection before closing it. This is how sub_295344 sends the collected data to the remote server.

 Based on the provided Main.cpp code, here is one way to hook sub_295344 to prevent sending data to the server:

1. Declare the original sub_295344 function pointer:

```cpp
void (__fastcall* osub_295344)(_BYTE, const char*);
```

2. Define the hook function:

```cpp 
void __fastcall sub_295344(_BYTE _a1, const char* a2) {

  // Save original function pointer
  osub_295344 = &sub_295344;
  
  // Your hook logic here
  _a1 = 0; // Disable logging

  // Call original function
  osub_295344(_a1, a2);
}
```

3. Apply the hook:

```cpp
// In lib_main()

HOOK_LIB("libanogs.so", "0x295344", sub_295344, osub_295344);
```

4. In the hook function:

- Save original function pointer 
- Set `_a1 = 0` to disable logging
- Call original function

This will prevent `sub_295344` from collecting and sending data to the server by disabling logging.

Let me know if you need any help integrating this hook into the provided Main.cpp code. I can provide a more complete code sample.

To summarize, the key functions that seem to handle network communication or transfer data that could be sent to a remote server are:

    sub_61998, sub_61A7E
    sub_62664, sub_636E6
    sub_4267C, sub_4398A
    sub_6E100, sub_701F2
    sub_6E51C, sub_6E5A0
    sub_6E100, sub_6EF8E
    sub_6E100, sub_6EF34
    sub_27C064
    sub_5AC3C, sub_5B2E8
    sub_292C88
    sub_6E100, sub_6EF9E
    sub_4C738, sub_4D1C0

To prevent data from being sent to the server, checks need to be added before calling these functions to validate the input and return early without calling these functions if the data should not be sent. The input buffer contents may also need to be scrubbed or randomized before passing to these functions.
